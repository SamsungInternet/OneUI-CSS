# Accessibility

At Samsung Internet we want to build a web that is accesible for everybody and we took this vision into OneUI Web.
OneUI Web is based on the One UI Design Accesibility Principles to ensure a fair, equal, and considerate user experience for everyone, regardless 
of their gender or physical condition. You can find the complete OneUI Design Guidelines [here](http://design.samsung.com/global/contents/one-ui/download/oneui_design_guide_eng.pdf).
The accessibility guidelines strive to meet the 
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG). 
Below some principles provided by the One UI Design team:


> - Consideration
>
>
> *Empathetic and detailed design for all users*
>
> At Samsung, we’re always trying to simplify our products’ interface, employing a 
> variety of research methodologies so that our design approach aligns with the needs and desires of our users. We strive to listen to our users and make a sincere effort to understand them, including those with disabilities. 
>
>
> - Comprehensive
>
> *Balanced and equal design for all users*
>
>
> We aim to design an interface for all users, regardless of whether they have a disability. 
> At Samsung, we believe that users with disabilities shouldn’t experience difficulty or discrimination when interacting with our products. We have set up guidelines in consideration of users with varying degrees of disabilities. From as early as the planning stage of each product, we try to ensure that it provides a holistic experience for all users.

>
> - Coherence
>
>
> *Consistent design experience for all products*

>
> Samsung products provide a variety of optional features for people with limited mobility. Moreover, continuous research and development in accessibility design should further ensure that all Samsung products offer an equal level of functionality for all their users.

> - Co-creation

>
>*Designed together*

>Samsung’s dedicated team of professionals from various fields provides training and support for users with disabilities to help them use Samsung products and services without difficulty. Employees with disabilities, research institutes, and like-minded communities and groups all work together to take a more hands-on approach to our design experience.

## Our Process to build a more inclusive web

In order to build a more inclusive web, developers are able to follow our accesible guide with examples.
For more details about how to implement accesible elements check each component section.

There are three levels of accessibility compliance in the WCAG:

- Level A: The basic accesible features. If this isn't met, assistive technology may not be able to read, understand, or fully operate the page or view.
- Level AA: Ideal support, deals with common barriers for disabled users. 
- Level AAA: High-level support. This is typically reserved for sites that serve a specialized audience.


One UI Web has a AA level, each component was tested using tools like [accesibility checker](https://achecker.ca/) and solving common problems related with:


- Content
Non-Text contents provides a text alternative to make sure that content is readable.


- Navigation
All functionality is available from the keyboard and users are able to find content without any problem.

- Compatibility
Maximize compatibility with assistive technologies (such as screen readers) and future browsers

## Coming Next

Even though we covered most case scenarios to help build accesible websites using OneUI Web, we also want to focus in different scenarios related with:

- Vision

Creating customizable themes that are accesible and helps user with vision problems like color blindness.

- Navigation

Build other components related with navigation including different types of menus and a search bar.

- PWA 

Bring accesibility into Progressive Web Apps is a must as OneUI Web main focus is to start as PWA tool.
